liri-node-app

Motivation-
App will provide fast and easy feedback to user for tweets, spotify and movie information by simply entering; user names (twitter), name of song if searching for a song you want to listen to and movie name to find quick information.  This application will also help me as an aspiring full stack dev understand node better.

To retrieve the data that will power this app, we will need to send requests to the Twitter, Spotify and OMDB APIs. You'll find these Node packages crucial for your assignment.
