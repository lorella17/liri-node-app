LIRI will display your latest tweets. As we do not want to display your personal account, or its keys, please make an alias account and add a few tweets to it!

To retrieve the data that will power this app, we will need to send requests to the Twitter, Spotify and OMDB APIs. You'll find these Node packages crucial for your assignment.
